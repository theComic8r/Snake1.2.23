# Snake2Rev1
A simple Snake game with high score and other stats.

Most of the main game mechanics are based off of Chris DeLeon's 4 minute Snake demonstration from 2017. 
I added wall collision, game over, winning, a high score system, and counters for times played and times won.
I also made the variables more descriptive in order to increase the code's readability.

Note: the spawn function for the food does not currently prevent the food from spawning within the snake's tail
this issue should be fixed in the near future.
